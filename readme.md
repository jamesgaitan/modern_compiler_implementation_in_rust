## About

This project is a Rust implementation of the information described in the book _Modern Compiler Implementation in C_.

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of compilers through this book and by implementing the concepts. I chose
to use Rust over C as a challenge, to strengthen my skill in Rust, and to force me to understand the concepts in the book and
not just follow along.

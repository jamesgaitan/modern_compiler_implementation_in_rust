## **NOTE**

This project is meant as a learning exercise. The code in this
project is _NOT_ well designed, implemented, documented, or tested. This
code is not meant to be used _ANYWHERE_ and is _NOT_ indicative of how I code
for a normal project.

## About

This project is a Rust implementation of the information described in the book _Modern Compiler Implementation in C_.

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of compilers through this book and by implementing the concepts. I chose
to use Rust over C as a challenge, to strengthen my skill in Rust, and to force me to understand the concepts in the book and
not just follow along.

## Concepts Studied

* Lexical Analysis and Tokenization

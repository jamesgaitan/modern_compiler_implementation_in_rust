## **NOTE**

This project is meant as a learning exercise. The code in this
project is _NOT_ well designed, implemented, documented, or tested. This
code is not meant to be used _ANYWHERE_ and is _NOT_ indicative of how I code
for a normal project.

## About

This project is a Rust implementation of the information described in the book _Modern Compiler Implementation in C_.

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of compilers through this book and by implementing the concepts. I chose
to use Rust over C as a challenge, to strengthen my skill in Rust, and to force me to understand the concepts in the book and
not just follow along.

The information learned in this book and future compiler books will be used to write the [pebble language](https://github.com/jamesgaitan/pebble). A language
I will be developing which is designed and implemented specifically for embedded systems. The language will use the LLVM toolchain.

## Concepts Studied

* Lexical Analysis and Tokenization (Chapter 2)
* Language Parsing  (Chapter 3)

## Skills/Tools Used

* Rust (All Chapters)
* Regular Expressions (Chapter 2)
